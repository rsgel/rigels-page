# Senior Design

I was the team lead for the “Personalized Lab Notifications” project as part of the University of Arizona interdisciplinary Senior Design program. The project was sponsored by Roche Tissue Diagnostics in Oro Valley, Arizona.

## Description

In high-volume medical laboratories, keeping track of the status of individual tissue staining devices is a difficult task, potentially leading to lost productivity or decreased awareness of device errors. This project provides a cloud-based notification system, built with Python, React Native, Node.JS, and MySQL, that delivers customizable notifications in real time from the Ventana HE 600 to subscribed users’ smartphones. The system includes two main software components: a centralized, server-based collection of cloud services hosted on AWS and an efficient log-parsing application on the device’s host computer. In a web frontend, users can select relevant machines and customize which types of notifications to receive, such as experiment completion, errors, or suggested maintenance. Users receive notifications through text messages or by using a cross-platform smartphone application, which provides native push notifications, and device notification history.
